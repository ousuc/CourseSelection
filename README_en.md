Digression: (can be skipped)
I messed up the warehouse many times this time
I'm really sorry

The database uses a C library to connect to postgresql  
Other modules do not pay special attention

#### 2 Questions about the main branch  
This accidentally pulled all the records of the dev branch directly   
So it may seem a bit chaotic and only two people contribute   
Contributions are mainly viewed in various branches    
#### 3 About the first iteration question   
The functionality of the first iteration was not fully implemented  
The teacher secretarial category will be set aside for the time being   
#### 4 Some questions about design
If you want to see how the database is designed  
The table can be viewed here https://github.com/ousuc/CourseSelection/tree/main/doc/dataBase_layer/design-doc   
Then there is the test data https://github.com/ousuc/CourseSelection/tree/main/doc/dataBase_layer/test_data  
Others, such as domain layer design, are also in doc documentation  
The main branch is mainly about accessing code that can be deployed directly to production  
The content of other branches will be relatively rich  
#### 5 Questions About Videos
Video is in the video branch The name may not be very appropriate  
Engineering files for PRs and AEs are included internally
